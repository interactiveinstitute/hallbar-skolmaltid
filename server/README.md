# H책llbar Skolm책ltid server

This is the repository for the backend for the H책llbar Skolm책ltid backend, started June 2020. The backend provides aggregated school data, for the project's frontend apps as well as direct api access.

The current setup encompasses
* A mongo db
* FIWARE Orion Context broker - the context data is accessed using the standardized [NGSIv2 REST API](https://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/).
* FIWARE Comet - the historical context data component - [Comet docs](https://fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* FIWARE Draco - basically an instance of [Apache NiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_NiFi) - for automating the flow of data between systems. Potentially useful for shuffling (and transforming)  data from sources into the backend.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that Docker is installed on the host.
If that is not the case, follow [Docker's installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

## Installation

...

## Execution

### Starting
To start the backend, do the following:

```bash
server/docker> docker-compose up
```

The first startup takes a while, since all containers are downloaded/built.

### Persistent data
**For empty database** - first time, or if mongo volume has been removed ... to initiate with some test data, either

**import** *hallbar_skolmaltid_server_init* collection in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and run (locally, or change collection variables accordingly) collection using Postman 'Runner' feature.

**OR**

  #### Restore
  Copy to container:

      server/docker> docker cp ../200618_rise_mongo.tar.gz db-mongo:/dump.tar.gz

  Uncompress:

      server/docker> docker exec db-mongo tar -xvzf dump.tar.gz

  Restore:

      server/docker> docker exec -it db-mongo mongorestore /dump

  #### Save
  Dump:

      server/docker> docker exec -it db-mongo mongodump --host localhost --port 27017 -o dump

  Compress:

      server/docker> docker exec -it db-mongo tar -zcvf 200618_rise_mongo.tar.gz dump

  Copy to host

      server/docker> docker cp db-mongo:/200618_rise_mongo.tar.gz ../

---
</details>

### Stopping
    server/docker> docker-compose down

## Usage

### Mongo DB
Used by both Orion and Comet.
Currently mapped to a local volume, which will be restored on start, unless you explicitly delete it.

### Orion/Comet
Some simple examples of using the orion/comet api are available as a postman collection in this directory.
[Orion API here](https://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/), [Comet docs here](https://fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Some examples:

Query orion for all schools, just getting ids

  http://{{orion}}/v2/entities?type=School&attrs=id

Query orion for entire user1

  http://{{orion}}/v2/entities/user1
  
Query orion for user1's related school1's schoolAttendanceObserved between dates:

  http://{{orion}}/v2/entities?type=SchoolAttendanceObserved&q=refSchool==school1;dateObserved==2020-02-01T10:00:00.00Z..2020-02-03T10:00:00.00Z

~~E.g. query comet for last three updates of schoolAttendance1~~

  ~~http://{{sth-comet}}/STH/v1/contextEntities/type/SchoolAttendance/id/schoolAttendance1/attributes/attendance?lastN=3~~

### Draco
The web GUI is available at http://localhost:9090/nifi
Currently the "flow" is saved/mapped from the server/docker/draco/conf directory.
